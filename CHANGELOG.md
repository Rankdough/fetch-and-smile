# Changelog

## 2026-05-25 - Broken-link checker with Firecrawl auto-fix

- **What:** New `fix-broken-links` edge function scans every external markdown link in the article (HEAD then GET, 8s timeout), and for each broken URL queries Firecrawl `/v2/search` using the link's anchor text + nearest heading; the first candidate that returns HTTP 200 replaces the broken URL in-place. If no working replacement is found, the link is removed and the anchor text is kept as plain prose. Afterwards the `## References` section is rebuilt deterministically from the remaining real markdown links so it never includes stale URLs. UI: new "Broken link checker" block in the Content Verification panel with a "Check & Fix Links" button and a results summary listing replaced/removed URLs.
- **Why:** User reported broken/hallucinated reference URLs and wanted a manual one-click way to verify and repair every link without losing the article body.
- **Verified broken:** Nothing verified broken. Checked: existing `verify-links` function untouched; `generate-content` + `regenerate-section` per-section Sources logic untouched; `setGeneratedContent` writes through the same path used by other fixes (em-dash, horizontal-line, internal-link insertion). The replacement step calls Firecrawl only when a URL fails the HTTP check, so working links are never touched.
- **What may break:** If `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` is missing or Firecrawl returns no working candidate, broken links are stripped (anchor text kept) — this is the requested behaviour but visually changes paragraphs that previously contained those links. Article word count can decrease slightly when many links are removed.
- **Files:** `supabase/functions/fix-broken-links/index.ts` (new), `src/components/ContentVerification.tsx`, `src/pages/Index.tsx`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Verify:** Generate or open an article with at least one external link, click "Check & Fix Links" in the Content Verification panel. The summary shows total/broken/replaced/removed counts; broken URLs that Firecrawl could repair are swapped in the body and the References section is rebuilt to match.



## 2026-05-25 - Fix stale warnings references after revert cleanup

- **What:** Removed remaining `warnings` conditionals and the last `integrityWarnings` dependency left after source-guard cleanup.
- **Why:** The cleanup removed the warning state but left references that caused TypeScript compile errors.
- **Verified broken:** Temporary TypeScript compile failure from stale `warnings` references in `src/pages/Index.tsx`; fixed before delivery.
- **Files:** `src/pages/Index.tsx`, `src/components/ContentVerification.tsx`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Verify:** `rg` confirms stale guard/warning strings are gone; `bunx vitest run src/test/example.test.ts` passes.

## 2026-05-25 - Remove stale source-guard revert leftovers

- **What:** Removed leftover source-integrity warning plumbing and source repair fallback behaviour from generation, section regeneration, and the editor wrapper. Kept the existing internal-link preservation logic unchanged.
- **Why:** The project revert did not clear all runtime/source-guard changes, and persisted editor state can make reverted code look unchanged in the preview.
- **Verified broken:** Nothing verified broken.
- **Files:** `src/pages/Index.tsx`, `src/components/ContentVerification.tsx`, `supabase/functions/generate-content/index.ts`, `supabase/functions/regenerate-section/index.ts`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Verify:** Search for removed guard strings and run the focused test suite.
